The client,  Artemis, is a worldwide financial consulting firm developing savings, retirement, investment, and insurance plans for their clients. Artemis needs a file verification web application added to ensure secure communications.


What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I feel confident in identifying flase positive vulnerabilities in the client's project. Software security adds safety and protection to a firm going them peace of mind that their and their clients information is safe.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

I found that very challenging, security is vital and whatever the task requires, one must be up to the challenge to succeed.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
In future I will ensure that secure connections exist between user and server. Online CVE databases are very useful to find solutions to mitigate vulnerabilities.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Rechecking with the Maven dependency checker tool was invaluable. 
Static and dynamic testing of the code was done.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The Maven dependency checker tool is extremely useful.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
To show I am compentent to find vulnerabilities, I may consider my use of the dependency checker.
